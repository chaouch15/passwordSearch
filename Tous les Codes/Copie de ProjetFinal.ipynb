Georges est camionneur de profession, mais avant tout de passion, passion qui l’a même poussé à arrêter ses études de mathématiques, lorsqu’il a découvert qu’un mathématicien était rarement amené à conduire des camions. Il aime également beaucoup les chiffres et les choses symétriques, comme nous avons pu le constater précédemment. Cette passion l’a même poussé par le passé à acheter des choses dont il n’avait absolument pas besoin, juste pour satisfaire la symétrie de son appartement. Georges vit donc dans un appartement, modeste loft positionné au plein centre de Toulouse, hérité de ses parents, décédés d’un accident de chasse il y a de cela des années. Pour ce qui est de l’héritage, Georges n’aura pas eu à se battre, étant fils unique, et voilà donc pourquoi il habite là, malgré un salaire de camionneur qui ne lui permettrais pas d’acheter pareil endroit. Georges est un homme de goût, et en tant qu’homme de goût, il aime manger son pâté de campagne sur un pain de mie Harrys (celui aux céréales). C’est en revenant de ses courses que l’accident est arrivé.
